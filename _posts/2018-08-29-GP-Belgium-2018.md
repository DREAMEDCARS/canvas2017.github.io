## The history of SPA Francochamps.

The circuit of SPA Francochamps was design by Jules de Tierre and  Henri Langlois Van Ophem in 1920 and it first race was in August 1921. The old Spa circuit was essentially a speed course with drivers managing higher average speeds than on other race tracks. At the time Spa was the fastest circuit in europe and it had a nasty reputation for being dangerous and very fast.
